# Better Scheme

This plugin complements Vim's default syntax files for scheme. It adds
rules for folding, more lispwords and highlights extra keywords.

It has special support for [CHICKEN Scheme](http://call-cc.org). But for
this you must define the variables `b:is_chicken` or `g:is_chicken`.

All in all this plugin is very minimal and only adds very few rules.
